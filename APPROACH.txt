APPROACH

First I started by creating a program to create IMU data.

It was done by using numpy to create arrays for linear acceleration and angular velocity.

Then I used a publisher to publish this data in imu format which was imported from sensor_msgs library.

For processing the data I read about a few filters like Kalman, madgwick, complementary filter and a few more.

I tried using the complementary filter but was unable to figure out a way to incorporate into my program.
